    1) Import video from a saved mp4 file or from a live video stream

    2) Separate this video into a list of frames

    3) Loop through each frame 1 by 1 and do the following actions:
        
        a) Resize the frame
            - TODO

        b) Blur the frame
            - Causes edges to have less of an impact on the contour and colour analysis

        c) Convert all the colours within the frame to Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) colours
            - Also known as Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB) colours
            - Better than using RGB colors because the RGB components of an object's colour are dependant upon the amount of light hitting it
